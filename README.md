   - **Why:** This serves as the basis for creating a clear and organized audio narration.
2. **Language Detection**:
   - **What:** Automatically detect the primary language using the `langdetect` library.  
   - **Why:** Ensures that the proper voice and pronunciation are applied.
3. **HTML to SSML Conversion**:
   - **What:** Convert HTML content into Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML).  
   - **Why:** SSML allows for better control over speech output, preserving the text structure while removing extraneous HTML tags.
4. **Voice Selection**:
   - **What:** Present a list of available voices based on the detected language.  
   - **Why:** Let users choose a voice that best fits their needs, adding a personal touch to the audio.
5. **Audio Configuration**:
   - **What:** Adjust pitch, speaking rate, and volume to fine-tune the output.  
   - **Why:** Customization options help in creating a pleasant and natural listening experience.
6. **Generate Audio**:
   - **What:** Process the SSML through the Text-to-Speech API to generate the audio file.  
   - **Why:** Converts your text into an engaging audio format.
7. **Output Verification**:
   - **What:** Save the output as `output.mp3` and play it back for quality assurance.  
   - **Why:** Ensures that the generated audio meets your expectations before further use.

### Outcome:
Your HTML content is transformed into a professionally generated audio file, making your content more inclusive and engaging.

## Step 2: HTML Translation üåç

Translate the text within your HTML file to a target language while preserving its original structure and formatting.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **API Configuration**:
   - **What:** Set up Google Generative AI with your predefined API key.  
   - **Why:** This enables the translation functionality.
2. **Input HTML File**:
   - **What:** Provide the file path of the HTML document that needs translation.  
   - **Why:** The file will be processed to extract text and structure.
3. **Language Selection**:
   - **What:** Choose the target language from a menu of options.  
   - **Why:** Allows for translation into the language of your choice.
4. **Create Translation Prompt**:
   - **What:** Construct a prompt that instructs the AI to translate only the text within HTML tags.  
   - **Why:** Ensures the original HTML structure is preserved while text is translated.
5. **Model Translation**:
   - **What:** Send the prompt to the AI model and receive the translated content.  
   - **Why:** Produces an accurate translation that maintains the integrity of the original document.
6. **Output File**:
   - **What:** Save the translated content to a new file (e.g., `Translated_hi.html`).  
   - **Why:** Creates a distinct version of the document that reflects the chosen target language.

### Outcome:
You receive an HTML file with translated text that preserves the original formatting‚Äîideal for multilingual web applications.

   - **What:** Use Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API to convert audio chunks into text.  
   - **Why:** Transcription is essential for further translation.
4. **Translate Transcription**:
   - **What:** Utilize Google Generative AI to translate the transcribed text into the target language.  
   - **Why:** Bridges the language gap, making content accessible to non-native speakers.
5. **Convert Translation to SSML**:
   - **What:** Process the translated text into SSML format.  
   - **Why:** Prepares the text for a high-quality text-to-speech conversion.
